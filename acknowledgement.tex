I like to convey my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor Professor Ravi Sandhu. I have  learned so many things from him. Every moment I was accompanied by him, I have perceived something new. Besides all his expertises that have guided me towards developing this thesis, his wisdom and generosity have inspired me to become a better human being.

I also like to thank Professor Krishnan for his generosity and guidance. He has always helped me to develop  new ideas and be critical on own work. He has encouraged me every time I meet him.

I also like to thank Prof. Jianwei Niu, Prof. Gregory White and Prof. Palden Lama for their valuable comments, time and insight in organizing this dissertation.

I also owe thanks to Farhan Patwa, who is always encouraging and inspiring. He has guided me all along in learning and contributing to OpenStack. 

 I would like to acknowledge our faculties from the Computer Science department, Suzan Tanaka from the ICS, Susan Allen and other staffs of our department for their kindness and relentless support. My gratitude also goes to all my friends and colleagues at UTSA---specially Ziaul Haque Olive who had invited me to join UTSA.
