%Logical-formulas and enumerated  tuples are two major ways to specify authorization policies in an ABAC model.  In this paper, we show that they are equivalent in theoretical expressive power. We also analyze these models beyond their expressive power. We show that logical-formulas are flexible and convenient for setting up new authorization  policies but they are difficult to update/administer policies. On the other hand, enumerated authorization policies can be difficult to set up by enumerating all possible tuples but they are convenient for policy update and administration. We further show usefulness of enumerated policies by demonstrating how it supports micro policies and how it can be extended to be represented in a canonical form. 

In this paper, we present a finite attribute finite domain ABAC model using enumerated authorization policies. We then compare enumerated authorization policy ABAC models (\EPModels) with logical-formula authorization policy ABAC (\LPModels) models in finite domain. We show that they are equivalent in term of theoretical expressive power. We also analyze these models beyond their expressive power. While, logical-formulas are flexible and convenient for setting up new authorization  policies, enumeration is convenient for updating or administering policies. We also show that enumerated authorization policies facilitate micro-policies and can easily be represented in a canonical form. Canonical representation and support for micro policies enable automated and scalable administration. 

%Micro policies along with its canonical representation can help in automated and scalable administration. 

%A natural question to ask how we can take advantage of both approaches so that both specification of new policies and administration of existing policies are convenient. Can we combine enumerated and logical formula policies? Can we canonicalize logical formulas and take advantage in policy administration? Further research is also required to better understand micro policies and canonicalization of authorization policies.
