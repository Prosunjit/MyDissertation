%Based on the representation of authorization policies, ABAC models can broadly be  categorized as \EPModels{} or \LPModels{}. While \LPModels{} models have been studied relatively well, development and characterization of \EPModels{} models are still on going. Policy Machine (PM) \cite{policy-machine} is an excellent example in this category. Interestingly, interpretation of attributes in PM is different from its traditional interpretation of (attribute name, value) pairs. On the other hand, \labac{} \cite{labac} is another example of \EPModels{}, but it is defined using only one user and one object attribute. This is why, in the next section, we define \EPMNModel{} as a finite domain \EPModels{} model having a bounded set of attributes. To the best of our knowledge, \EPMNModel{} is the first multi-attribute \EPModels{} model. On the other hand, several \LPModels{} models (e.g. \cite{abacAlpha,hgabac,abac-for-web-service}) have been defined.  They differ in the design and complexity of policy language. We also define a LAP model named \LPMN{}  by abstracting its policy language and potentially accepting any computational logic as policy language. Thus, we can claim that \LPMN{} can subsume the most expressive policy language which further generalizes our equivalence results presented in Section \ref{sec:equivalence}.  

In this section, we define a multi-attribute enumerated authorization policy ABAC model named \EPMNModel{}. To the best of our knowledge, \EPMNModel{} is the first such model. \PM{}\cite{policy-machine} also defines a multi-attribute \EPModels{} model, but their interpretation of attributes is different than the traditional interpretation of \textit{(attr. name, value)} pairs. We also define a multi-attribute \LPModels{} model named \LPMN{}  by abstracting its policy language and potentially accepting any computational logic as policy language. While existing \LPModels{} models  define their own policy language, \LPMN{} can subsume any policy language which further generalizes our equivalence results presented in the following section.
