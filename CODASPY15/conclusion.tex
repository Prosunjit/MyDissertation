\section{Conclusion}
As more and more data is being uploaded in the cloud, data may contain sensitive information. With existing Swift API, one can either access the full content of an object or cannot access it at all. We  propose an extension of Swift Object Server where someone can specify  policies on a Swift object at the content level  and let different users access different parts of it.  We hope that this work would help Swift users to share objects effectively with others having more control at the content level.
