\chapter{Enforcement of \eapABAC{} models.}
In this section, we demonstrate usefulness of EAP models by enforcing them in different application contexts. Firstly, we use \eapABAC{} to design a protection model for JSON documents. In the second case, we design a protection model for OpenStack Swift storage.  They are discussed in detail in the following sections.
\section{Protection model for JSON Documents}
	In this section, we design a protection model for JSON documents. In the following sub-section, we discuss our motivation for choosing JSON data model. We also discuss salient properties semi-structured JSON data and justify our approach over existing XML protection mechanisms.
