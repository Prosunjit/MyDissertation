\section{Problem statement and thesis}
\subsection{Problem statement}
There are two major techniques for specifying authorization policies in Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC). The more conventional approach is to define policies using logical formulas involving attribute values. The alternate technique is by enumeration. While considerable work has been done for the former approach, the later  lacks fundamental work from the research community.

\subsection{Thesis}
\textit{Enumerated Authorization Policy ABAC (EAP-ABAC) model is a viable alternate to Logical-formula Authorization Policy ABAC (LAP-ABAC) model. EAP-ABAC is as expressive as LAP-ABAC in the finite domain. EAP-ABAC models can be enforced in different application domains.}
