\chapter{Comparing EAP and LAP ABAC models in expressive power}
	In Section \ref{sec:epmodel}, we present an multi-attribute EAP ABAC (\EPMNModel{}) model. In this section, we first define a multi-attribute LAP model---\LPMN{}. We then compare \EPMNModel{} with  \LPMN{} with respect to their theoretical expressive power.  We show that in the finite domain, multi-attribute EAP and LAP models are equivalent with respect to their theoretical expressive power. Additionally, we show that single and multi-attribute EAP models are equivalent as well as single and multi-attribute LAP models are equivalent w.r.t. to their theoretical expressive power.
