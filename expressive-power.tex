\chapter{Comparing Enumerated and Logical-Formula Authorization-Policy Models}
\label{sec:expresssive-power}
	In this chapter, we compare enumerated and logical-formula authorization policy ABAC models with respect to their theoretical expressive power. In this connection, we define a multi-attribute LAP model called \LPMN{}. We also simplify \EPMNModel{} model defined in the last section.  We then compare \EPMNModel{} with  \LPMN{} with respect to expressive power.  We show that in the finite domain, multi-attribute EAP and LAP models are equivalent with respect to their theoretical expressive power. Additionally, we show that single and multi-attribute EAP models are equivalent, as well as single and multi-attribute LAP models are equivalent with respect to their theoretical expressive power.
